Significance tests aka. statistical hypothesis tests are used in A/B test.

Generally, data samples need to be representative of the domain and large enough to expose their distribution to analysis.
In some cases, the data can be corrected to meet the assumptions, such as correcting a nearly normal distribution to be normal by removing outliers, or using a correction to the degrees of freedom in a statistical test when samples have differing variance, to name two examples.

Finally, there may be multiple tests for a given concern, e.g. normality. We cannot get crisp answers to questions with statistics; instead, we get probabilistic answers. As such, we can arrive at different answers to the same question by considering the question in different ways. Hence the need for multiple different tests for some questions we may have about data.
