Using this clustering module to try different clustering methods and get cluster insight quickly.<br>

As clustering in machine learning always depends on some subjective assumptions, try k-mean at the very beginning to investigate clusters.<br>
Then try other clustering methods according to the result of k-means.<br>

Use the following two methods to evaluate clusters.
- elbow function (hard to find an elbow in most cases)
- silhouette analysis (useful when looking for clusters that are similar size)
